Here kwds... represent keywords that are passed to FitsFile. The call writefits!(args...; kwds...) is a shortcut for writefits(args...; overwrite = true, kwds...) which overwrites filename if it already exists.\n\nIn EasyFITS, there are many different possible ways to specify a HDU header and data:\n\nA header may be nothing if there are no additional keywords other than the structural keywords describing the data part. Otherwise, the possible types for a header are given by the union EasyFITS.Header: a header may be a collection of FitsCard instances (i.e. an instance of FitsHeader, a tuple, or a vector of FITS cards), a named tuple, a tuple or a vector of pairs like key => val or key => (val, com) with key the keyword name, val its value, and com a comment.\nFor a FITS Image HDU, the data part is specified as a numerical Julia array.\nFor a FITS Table HDU, the data part may be specified by a dictionary (whose keys are the column names and whose values are the corresponding column data), a vector of column data, a named tuple, a tuple or a vector of pairs like col => val with col the column name and val the column data. The data of each column of a table is a Julia array, the number of rows of the table is the last dimension of these arrays which must be the same for all columns.\n\nCalling writefits or writefits!, the structure of the resulting FITS file can be made obvious by the code as in the following complex example with array arr saved in the primary HDU and two tables in the next HDUs:\n\nusing Dates, EasyFITS\nfilename = \"/tmp/test.fits\";\narr = rand(Float32, (3,4,5));\nnrows = 20;\ninds = 1:nrows;\nspeed = rand(Float64, nrows);\nmass = rand(Float32, nrows);\nposition = rand(Float32, 3, nrows);\nphase = (1:7) .// 3;\namplitude = exp.(-1:-1:-7);\nx = amplitude.*cos.(phase);\ny = amplitude.*sin.(phase);\nwritefits(filename,\n          #-----------------------------------------------------------------\n          # First HDU must be a FITS \"image\", but data may be empty.\n          #\n          # Header part as a vector of `key=>val` or `key=>(val,com)` pairs:\n          [\"DATE\"    => (now(), \"date of creation\"),\n           \"HISTORY\" => \"This file has been produced by EasyFITS\",\n           \"USER\"    => ENV[\"USER\"]],\n          # Data part as an array:\n          arr,\n          #-----------------------------------------------------------------\n          # Second HDU, here a FITS \"table\".\n          #\n          # Header part of 2nd HDU as a tuple of pairs:\n          (\"EXTNAME\" => (\"MY-EXTENSION\", \"Name of this extension\"),\n           \"EXTVER\"  => (1, \"Version of this extension\")),\n          # Data part is a table in the form of a named tuple:\n          (Speed    = (speed, \"km/s\"),  # this column has units\n           Indices  = inds,             # not this one\n           Mass     = (mass, \"kg\"),\n           Position = (position, \"cm\")),\n          #-----------------------------------------------------------------\n          # Third HDU, another FITS \"table\".\n          #\n          # Header part of 3rd HDU as a named tuple (note that keywords must\n          # be in uppercase letters):\n          (EXTNAME = (\"MY-OTHER-EXTENSION\", \"Name of this other extension\"),\n           EXTVER  = (1, \"Version of this other extension\"),\n           COMMENT = \"This is an interesting comment\"),\n          # Data part is a table in the form of a vector of pairs (column names\n          # can be strings or symbols but not a mixture):\n          [:phase => ((180/π).*phase, \"deg\"),\n           :amplitude => (amplitude, \"V\"),\n           :xy => (hcat(x,y)', \"mm\")])\n\nThe difference between writefits or writefits! is that writefits! silently overwrite filename if it already exists while writefits would complain and refuse to do that unless keyword overwrite=true is set.","category":"section"},{"location":"writing/#Advanced-writing-of-a-FITS-file","page":"Writing FITS files","title":"Advanced writing of a FITS file","text":"Direct writing of a FITS file with writefits or writefits! is designed to write all the content of a FITS file in a single function call and with a syntax that readily shows the structure of the file. This is not suitable when not all content is immediately available or when it is more convenient to write the FITS file piece by piece. The latter is typically done by the following steps:\n\nCreate a new empty FITS file for writing with the FitsFile constructor or the openfits function.\nStart a new HDU with the FitsImageHDU constructor or the FitsTableHDU constructor.\nInstantiate the FITS keywords of the header part of the HDU.\nWrite the data part of the HDU. This may be done by chunks and this depends on whether the HDU is a FITS Image or a FITS Table.\nEventually close the FITS file with close. Closing the FITS file is automatically done when the object representing the file is no longer used and garbage collected, closing the file is therefore optional. However, explicitly closing the file makes sure that its content is effectively written.\n\nRemarks:\n\nSteps 2 to 4 can be repeated as many times as necessary to create more than one HDU.\n\nFor example, with arr a Julia array to be written in the data part of the HDU:\n\n# 1. Create the file:\nfile = FitsFile(filename, \"w\")\n# 2. Start a new HDU to store array data `arr`:\nhdu = FitsImageHDU(file, arr)\n# 3. Set some keywords in the header part of the HDU:\nhdu[\"HDUNAME\"] = (\"SOME_NAME\", \"Name of this HDU\")\nhdu[\"COMMENT\"] = \"Some comment.\"\n# 4. Write the data part of the HDU:\nwrite(hdu, arr)\n# 5.

This is partially ensured by the type assertions in the @ccall macro. It is also necessary to check whether a pointer to some opaque structure in the library is valid.\nPreserving objects from being destroyed while being in use. Of course, this is automatically done by Julia for Julia objects, but must be handled for references or pointers to objects provided by the CFITSIO library.\n\nWhen an object obj is specified for an argument of type Ptr{T} to be passed to a C function, Julia ccall does something like:\n\nref = Base.cconvert(Ptr{T}, obj)\nptr = Base.unsafe_convert(Ptr{T}, ref)\nresult = GC.@preserve ref call_some_c_function(..., ptr, ...)\n\nHere ref is an object (by default, Base.cconvert(Ptr{T},obj) yields obj itself) to be used with Base.unsafe_convert(Ptr{T},ref) to get the pointer and to be preserved from being garbage collected in order to warrant that the pointer remains valid.\n\nThanks to this mechanism, it is quite simple to ensure that valid pointers to opaque structures of the CFITSIO library be passed to a function of this library. For example, the code below is how is handled a pointer to a fitsfile C structure in our code:\n\nisnull(ptr::Ptr{T}) where {T} = ptr === Ptr{T}(0)\ncheck(ptr::Ptr) = isnull(ptr) ? error(\"invalid NULL pointer\") : ptr\nget_handle(file::FitsFile) = getfield(obj, :handle)\nget_file(hdu::AbstractHDU) = getfield(hdu, :file)\nBase.unsafe_convert(Ptr{CFITSIO.fitsfile}, obj::FitsFile) = check(get_handle(obj))\nBase.cconvert(Ptr{CFITSIO.fitsfile}, hdu::AbstractHDU) = get_file(hdu)\n\nPrivate methods isnull and check are introduced for readability. Private methods get_handle and get_file are two of the private accessors introduced to hide the fields of a FITS file object and let some other public properties be implemented. The former yields the pointer to the fitsfile C structure that is managed by a FitsFile object, while the latter yields the FitsFile object storing the HDU as it is the one that must be used and preserved when calling a C function requiring a pointer to a fitsfile C structure.\n\nNote that FitsFile objects have a finalizer that automatically releases resources such as the associated fitsfile C structure when the object is garbage collected.","category":"section"},{"location":"devel/#Helper-functions","page":"Notes for developers","title":"Helper functions","text":"The following non-exported functions are provided for meta-programming and for dealing with the types of arguments in calls to the functions of the CFITSIO library.","category":"section"},{"location":"devel/#Pixel-types","page":"Notes for developers","title":"Pixel types","text":"The following table lists conventions used by CFITSIO for pixel types, that is the BITPIX keyword in FITS image extensions.\n\nType Code Julia Type BITPIX\nBYTE_IMG UInt8 8\nSBYTE_IMG Int8 \nSHORT_IMG Int16 16\nUSHORT_IMG UInt16 \nLONG_IMG Int32 32\nULONG_IMG UInt32 \nLONGLONG_IMG Int64 64\nULONGLONG_IMG UInt64 \nFLOAT_IMG Float32 -32\nDOUBLE_IMG Float64 -64\n\nTypes without a value in the BITPIX column are converted by the CFITSIO library into the other signed/unsigned type using special values of the BSCALE and BZERO keywords to allow for the reciprocal conversion.

Keyword ext may however be set with a number, a name, or a predicate function to select another extension. Another possibility is to specify the keyword extended = true to open the file using the extended file name syntax implemented by the CFITSIO library.\n\nIf no optional arguments args... are specified, all the data part of the selected FITS HDU is read and returned. Otherwise, arguments args... indicate which part the HDU data to read:\n\nFor a FITS Image HDU, args... specifies the ranges of pixels to read along the dimensions with a syntax similar to that of sub-arrays or views in Julia. For example:\ndata = readfits(filename, :, :, 5)\nwould read the 5th slice in a 3-dimensional image. This is equivalent but more efficient than:\ndata = readfits(filename)[:, :, 5]\nwhich amounts to reading all the data and then only keep the 5th slice.\nFor a FITS Table HDU, args... may be up to 2 arguments, say cols and rows, to respectively select a subset of columns and rows (if the latter is not specified, all rows of the table are read). For example:\nA = readfits(filename, (\"Speed\", \"Height\"))\nB = readfits(filename, :, 11:40)\nrespectively yield the columns named Speed and Height of the table and all the columns of the table but only for rows in the range 11:40. Keyword case may be used to indicate whether letter case does matter in the column names.\n\nnote: Note\nIn EasyFITS, the rows of a table correspond to the last dimension of arrays. This is to have the same storage order in memory and in the FITS file. Method permutedims can be used is this convention does not suit you.\n\nThe type of the object returned by readfits depends on the kind of the FITS extension and may also depend on the optional arguments args...:\n\nFor a FITS Image HDU, the read data is returned as a Julia Array.\nFor a FITS Table HDU, if cols is a single column name or number, an array of the columns values is returned, otherwise, a dictionary indexed by the column names is returned. Note that, a column range like 4:4 would yield a dictionary with a single column (the 4th one). Keywords case and rename are available to indicate how to search the columns by name in the table and how to translate these names into dictionary keys.\n\nTo avoid ambiguities or for improved type-stability, an optional leading type argument can be specified in readfits to indicate the expected type of the returned data:\n\ndata = readfits(R::Type, filename, args...; kwds...)\n\nwhich warrants that data isa R holds. For a FITS Image extension, array type parameters such as the element type and the number of dimensions may be specified in R. For example:\n\ndata = readfits(Array{Float32,3}, filename)\n\nensures that data is a single precision floating-point 3-dimensional array; while:\n\ndata = readfits(Dict, filename, cols; ext=2)\n\nensures that the table in 2nd FITS Header Data Unit is returned as a dictionary even though cols specifies a single column.","category":"section"},{"location":"reading/#Direct-reading-of-a-FITS-header","page":"Reading FITS files","title":"Direct reading of a FITS header","text":"For efficiency, FITS headers are returned as instances of FitsHeader provided by the FITSHeaders package.

Properties hdu.first_row and hdu.last_row can be used to retrieve the first and last row numbers of hdu.\n\nThe read method automatically guess the number of dimensions and the type of the elements of the Julia array representing the column of a table. To improve type stability, the read method takes an optional first argument to specify the type of the result, from the least specific Array to Array{T} or Array{T,N}.

Specify keyword case=true if columns are specified by their (symbolic) names and the case of these names matters.\n\nThe result of reading several columns is a dictionary whose keys are the names of the columns and whose values are the cells of the columns. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the table columns unconverted if keyword case=true and converted to upper-case letters otherwise. If this is not suitable, use the keyword rename to specify a function to modify the names of the columns. For example, with rename=identity the names of the columns will be left unchanged whatever the keyword case while with rename=lowercase the names of the columns will be converted to lower-case letters.\n\nIn order to retrieve the units of the columns, specify keyword units=String and get a dictionary whose values are 2-tuples of the form (data,units) with data the column cells and units the column units as a string. The default behavior, that is to get a dictionary whose values are simply the cells of the columns, corresponds to units=nothing.\n\nTo have a dictionary when cols is a single column name/number, just specify the type of the expected result as the leading argument. For example:\n\ndict = read(Dict, hdu)\ndict = read(Dict, hdu, cols)\ndict = read(Dict, hdu, cols, rows)\n\nOf course, this also works if the cols argument represents several columns without ambiguities.\n\nThe leading type argument may be more specific. For example:\n\ndict = read(Dict{String,Array}, hdu, cols)\n\nis the same as with Dict, while:\n\ndict = read(Dict{String,Vector}, hdu, cols, rows)\n\ncan only be successful if all read columns have 0-dimensional cells.\n\nIf the leading argument is more specific than Dict, the units=String keyword is not allowed and retrieving the units is done by specifying that the values are tuples of an array and a string. For example:\n\ndict = read(Dict{String,Tuple{Array,String}}, hdu, cols)\n\nUsing the leading type argument, it is also possible to retrieve a vector of the table columns (in the same order as specified in cols).
